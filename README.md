## plan
  -  first create all cross-objects
  - working with 3 layer architecture.
  **UI** | **BL** | **DL**
  starting with UI, work until all the abilities badly work in this layer and then pass to BL and etc.
  after finishing the first cycle, i start again but now I refactor and improve my previous work.repeating this process until I finish
